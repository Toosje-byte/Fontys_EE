# Introduction

## Mood Room

Our project was about creating sensors and actuators that could influence the mood of a room. We first needed to figure out what influences the mood, afterwards we thought about actuators that could influence these things and finally the sensors to measure the current mood.

## Temperature Sensor

One of the things that influence the mood is the temperature of a room, if a room is a little chilly you will be better at focusing, conversely if a room is a little warm you will relax better.

There are multiple ways to measure the temperature but i decided to design a circuit that uses a resistor that changes its  resistance based on the temperature it is exposed to. I did not have the time to make the actuators, instead i used two LEDs to indicate if a heater or cooler is turned on.
